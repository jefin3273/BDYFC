# 🌐 BDYFC Website

> A fully automated and scalable web platform built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Supabase**, and **Node.js**, designed to streamline onboarding, user access, and operational management for community churches.

## 📌 About the Project

BDYFC Website is a web-based portal designed to serve as a centralized hub for community churches, their members, and managing teams. The platform offers seamless onboarding, role-based access control, event tracking, announcements, and internal team management — all built to reduce manual intervention and improve communication across church bodies.

This project was not only an initiative to solve a real-world need within our community but also a deep dive into building scalable, production-ready applications from the ground up.

## 📚 Learning & Development

This project has been a personal milestone. As the **sole developer**, I built and managed:

- The **entire codebase and architecture**: backend, frontend, auth, and database.
- The **CI/CD pipeline** via Vercel.
- A scalable data model and **clean component design** using modern best practices.

From designing the schema to implementing secure auth flows and user dashboards, every feature was built hands-on — helping me deeply understand full-stack web development with a production-first mindset.

My team supported in **ideation and feature planning**, but all technical development — from conception to deployment — was self-handled.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Advanced **authentication systems** using Supabase (handling edge cases, token management, and secure routes)
- **Type-safe development** with TypeScript
- Designing and building a **relational database schema**
- Structuring reusable components and **maintainable code architecture**
- Managing state effectively across client and server
- Implementing **dynamic routing, server-side rendering**, and edge functions with Next.js
- Building a system that is **developer-independent** post-deployment

## 🚀 Deployment

- **Live Site**: [https://bdyfc.vercel.app/](https://bdyfc.vercel.app/)
- Hosted on **Vercel** with GitHub integration for automated deployments.
